# Pong

This github repo contains my recreation of the game "Pong" writen in C using raylib

As of right now it only has ball movement implemented.

Installation Instructions:
( Linux machines with C standard library installed ):

If raylib is not already installed then:
on arch based distros run:

    sudo pacman -S raylib

If lazy run:

    git clone https://github.com/sillythewanderer/C-Pong; cd C-Pong/src; make; ./Pong

If not lazy:

chose a folder to store this small game and open that folder in a terminal emulator 
(like KDE Konsole or Kitty)

then clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/sillythewanderer/C-Pong

enter the src folder

from the src folder run:

    make

this command makes a linux executable file called "Pong"

then lastly run the binary with:

    ./Pong

you can also run it in a gui

I might make precompiled binaries eventually
